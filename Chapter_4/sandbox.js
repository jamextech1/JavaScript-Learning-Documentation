// FUNCTION DECLARATION
function greet() {
  console.log(`Hello there`);
}

// FUNCTION EXPRESSION
// now this is a function expression,  also we don't need to give the functoion a name because the function name is already the variable. Also, at the end of every expression there's always a semi colon, so that's why this function's curly brackets has a semi colon at the end.
const speak = function () {
  console.log(`good day!`);
};
// calling function
greet();
